# Loan Prediction System

## Overview
An automated loan prediction system that uses machine learning to predict loan approval probability. This project implements a binary classification model with a user-friendly GUI for real-time predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Machine learning model for loan approval prediction
- Interactive GUI for user input
- Visualization of prediction results
- Model performance metrics
