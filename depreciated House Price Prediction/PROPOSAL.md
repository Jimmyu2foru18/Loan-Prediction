# House Price Prediction Project Proposal

## Summary
This proposal outlines a machine learning project aimed at developing an accurate housing price prediction model for the Boston housing market. 
By leveraging advanced regression techniques and comprehensive data analysis, we aim to create a robust system that can estimate house prices based on various property and neighborhood characteristics.

## Project Scope
### Primary Objectives
- Develop a production-ready machine learning pipeline for house price prediction
- Implement and compare multiple regression models to identify performance
- Create a reproducible data processing workflow for future scaling
- Deliver actionable insights about housing market factors

### Deliverables
1. Automated data preprocessing pipeline
2. Trained regression models (Linear, Ridge, and Lasso)
3. Interactive Dashboard
4. Documentation and API specifications
5. Final performance analysis report

## Technical Approach
### Data Source
We will utilize the Boston Housing Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schirmerchad/bostonhoustingmlnd), which includes:
- 506 entries with 14 distinct features
- Key attributes: rooms (RM), population status (LSTAT), student-teacher ratio (PTRATIO)
- Target variable: Median house value (MEDV)

### Methodology
1. **Data Analysis & Preparation**
   - Exploratory data analysis with statistical summaries
   - Feature correlation analysis and visualization
   - Systematic outlier detection and handling
   - Missing value treatment using advanced imputation techniques

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Standard scaling implementation (μ=0, σ=1)
   - Creation of interaction terms for complex relationships
   - Feature selection based on importance metrics
   - Dimension reduction if necessary

3. **Model Development**
   - Baseline: Linear Regression implementation
   - Advanced: Ridge and Lasso Regression with regularization
   - Hyperparameter optimization using grid search
   - 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation

## Implementation Plan
### Technical Stack
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn for model development
- pandas & numpy for data manipulation
- matplotlib & seaborn for visualization
- Flask/FastAPI for potential API deployment

### Quality Assurance
- Unit tests for all pipeline components
- Cross-validation for model reliability
- Code review and documentation standards
- Performance benchmarking against industry standards
